# Media & Assets

## Photos
Project photos live in:
- `t-photos/` team images
- `v-photos/` vehicle multi‑angle shots

Consider adding compressed web‑friendly versions if repository size becomes large.

## Schematics
- `schemes/` includes the PNG wiring schematic. Duplicate here only if variant versions appear.

## Video Demonstrations
Create `media/video.md` (or update existing) with:
```
# Demo Videos
- Track run (date) – https://...
- Corner detection showcase – https://...
```

## Badges / Social Preview
Add a repository social preview image (GitHub settings) using a composite of the front, top, and team photo.
