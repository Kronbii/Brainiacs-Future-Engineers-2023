## Electrical Architecture
See `schemes/` for the full wiring schematic. Key buses:
- I2C: MPU6050, TCS34725
- PWM: Servo output from Mega
- UART / USB: Jetson â†” Mega (command & telemetry)

## Power Notes
- Separate regulated rails recommended: logic 5V vs motor supply.
- Common ground between Jetson, Arduinos, and motor driver.

## Mechanical / CAD
3D printable models reside in `models/`. Provide assembly order:
1. Mount Jetson carrier.
2. Install drive motor & gear interface.
3. Attach steering servo + linkage.
4. Fix sensor mast (camera + color + IMU).

## Future Hardware Improvements
- Add wheel encoders for closed-loop velocity.
- Shift to a more efficient motor driver (MOSFET based).
- Integrate fused distribution board.
